This project performs a comprehensive statistical analysis and data mining exploration of crime trends in the United States over a 50-year period (1973–2023).

The goal is to investigate the "Great Crime Decline" of the 1990s, the recent volatility during the post-2020 era, and the disparities between reported crime (FBI UCR) and experienced victimization (NCVS).
